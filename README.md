    # keylogger is a software designed to track all key strokes and give us a record.
    # We will first just track key strokes, but with the passage of time we will also
    # track track other things like speed and mistakes etc.

    # Main file contains back end scripting of key strokes
    # Another file named key_gui will be used for user interface
    # We will also try using sqlite for database in this project.
